## Description
For this project, I have created a Social-Network API which can Create A User and a Thought while also having Friends to your User Array and Reactions to your Thoughts Array. In this API, you can create a User/Thought, Get All or One User/Thought, Delete Users/Thoughts and update Users/Thoughts. 

## Installation
You can Install this application by doing the following:
1. Clone This Code into your VSC or any other Coding Programme you use.
2. Navigate to the Index.js in the root folder and in the terminal write 'node index.js' which will create the server.
3. From there you can open the url in Insomnia or Postman and make as many requests as you like.

## Technologies 
The Technologies I have used are:
1. Node.js
2. Express.js (Router)
3. Mongoose DB
4. Insomnia
5. Visual Studio Code
